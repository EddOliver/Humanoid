# Humanoid
Account abstraction wallet.


# Polygon 
Polygon is our main side "mempool" where we deploy our main Smart contract that deals with Account Abstraction.

# WalletConnect

We use walletconnect to login to the system via our main wallet in order to reach most of the services, said wallet can also be recovered via PoH.

# Ethereum Foundation

The main technical aspects of the project revolve around reaching a PoC of Account Abstraction using Polygon in this case, but our main purpose is much more related trying to solve ownership disputes creating a public goods offering that can tackle this. Which is one of the biggest problems in LATAM.

# Push Protocol

We are using Push Protocol to receive notifications whenever the main user has passed verification.

# UMA
We are mainly using UMA's oracle for our price feeds in our main landing screen that shows the wallet's balance.

# Streamr Network

Websockets for our IoT fingerprint service and miscelaneous notifications.

# Livepeer

Face redcognition for additional verification when recovering the wallet.



# XMTP

Chat messages between wallets and Humanoid users.

# OpenZeppelin

Smart contracts for ERC-20 and NFTs.
